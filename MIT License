✅ **How to use it on GitHub so Mermaid works correctly:**  

1. Make sure you are using a **`.md` file** (README.md).  
2. GitHub **supports Mermaid diagrams natively** now. Use triple backticks with `mermaid` exactly like above.  
3. Save your **dashboard screenshot** as `dashboard_image.png` in the repo root or in `dashboard/` folder.  
4. Commit and push — both the diagram and image will render.

If you want, I can also **write the Markdown with a working placeholder image and example Mermaid screenshot**, so it’s **fully portfolio-ready** for your GitHub page.  

Do you want me to do that next?
